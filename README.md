## SQLDrill_LibMgmt
This was a practice drill using SQL and Microsoft SQL Server. The task: from looking at a graphic of a library management database containing 7 tables, develop a schema and create the database. Then I had to populate the tables with data that I created, conforming to certain rules specified, then write 7 queries to answer specific questions given and turn one of the queries into a stored procedure.
